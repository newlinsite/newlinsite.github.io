			<h2>To get the knowledge of what Live Stream is and define its key points.</h2>
			<p>
				We collected and categorized all common types of webcasting, and based on the historical development and
				recent changes in webcasting, we divided it into the following stages and list the characteristics of
				each.
				We found that the level of interaction and equipment expertise are the two key technically essential
				points of this industry, and there are different solutions in the market based on these two points.
				Finally, from the development process, we found that almost all types of live streaming are evolving
				towards increased interactivity and broadcast level for some reasons, namely the Program Live Streaming
				category in the figure.
			</p>
			<img src="image/design_uiux-uc_03.png" style="max-width: 1200px;">
			<h2>The three types of change trends in Streaming Live</h2>
			<p>
				By converting the development process into four quadrants, we can see the trend flow more clearly,
				respectively; the old media want to increase its channels to broad participation or interaction by the
				internet. It is towards the right.
				And the new media recently started to move upward, which means the increased demand for equipment and
				converted programs to broadcast-level programs.
				Finally, remote education and seminar, which are increasing in the covid-19, need improved
				communication, interaction, and rich content, which means the need for equipment requirement and
				interactivity are increased.
			</p>
			<img src="image/design_uiux-uc_04.png">
			<h2>Based on the existing technology capabilities, excluding the incompetent interactions,
				We chose the yellow and blue colors in the above matrix as the target audience
				and aimed to help them complete the cross-border.</h2>
			<p>
				Live streaming looks simple, but there are very complex technologies behind it.
				We can see from the technical analysis chart that the technology of interaction is mainly in the hands
				of the platform, which is not our strength. Still, integrating the relative front-end devices is our
				strength, so we focus on the content and equipment.
			</p>
			<img src="image/design_uiux-uc_05.png">

			<h2>But the cross-border movement is strenuous;
				Increasing the equipment and industry knowledge required is challenging in the third quadrant.</h2>
			<p>
				Nowadays, most people start live streaming directly from a cell phone or laptop, but if you want to go
				to the next level, you will encounter many technical difficulties at once
			</p>

			<div class="session">Problem discovery and solution</div>
			<h2>Based on the users targeted in the above scenario,</br>
				we find their pain points in equipment set-up and live operation.</h2>
			<img src="image/design_uiux-uc_06.5.png" class="left" style="max-width: 600px;">
			<h3>1. Difficulty in hardware installation</h3>
			<p>
				The number of devices is exponentially increasing, and different video and audio sources require
				different cables and adapter devices, so setting up the devices will require more professional
				knowledge. In addition, the number of pieces of equipment connected is easy to make mistakes during live
				streaming.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Lack of professional staff and knowledge to do an excellent job of program content</h3>
			<p>
				To make good programming, it needs professional functions and knowledge of the broadcasting industry, as
				well as the support of experienced staff such as directors, sound controllers, and graphic stuff
			</p>
			<h3>3. Don't know how to LIVE where you want to be</h3>
			<p>
				This is the responsibility of the Master control in the traditional broadcasting industry, controlling
				its many channels, which requires a great deal of professional knowledge.
			</p>
			<h2>1. Difficulty in hardware installation : </br>
				Integration of a large number of professional hardware equipment</h2>
			<p>
				Professional live streaming requires many devices; we work with the PM to develop a corresponding i/o to
				complete all functions in one machine, significantly reducing the difficulty of connecting devices.
				Take the following picture as an example of a music teaching situation. Initially, many devices were
				needed, including Video capturers, Audio mixers, Audio interfaces, Controler, etc., and professional
				hardware knowledge was required.
				However, afterward, we only need to connect all the devices we want to broadcast to one device to
				complete the installation.

			<h2>2. Lack of professional staff and knowledge to do an excellent job of program content</h2>
			<h3>Easy but professional directing function</h3>
			<p>
				Make the professional director's preview and switching function easier, allowing users to easily switch
				and monitor each screen through their iPad or computer.
			</p>
			<img src="image/design_uiux-uc_09.png" class="left">
			<h3>Converted programs to broadcast level programs</h3>
			<p>
				Innovative scene-based operations reduce the need for streaming live workforce to achieve
				broadcast-quality programming.
				Easy to use word cards and complete multi-camera screen processing.

			<h3>Simplify audio mixer functionality and add automated features</h3>

			<h2>3. Don't know how to LIVE where you want to be:</br>Open and easy-to-use multiple streaming channels
			</h2>
			<p>Integrate common live streaming channels and stream them through a simple UI, including support for
				Oauth, Stream key RTDP, and common online platforms, and also help customize live streaming to other
