					This solution is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that leverages advanced deep learning technology to
					deliver lifelike, near-native Mandarin Chinese voice synthesis with minimal effort for any
					speech-enable
					application or device.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project attempts to build an MVP to find the market fit quickly in a traditional waterfall
					model
					development environment. After confirming the existence of the market, create a solution to meet the
					user needs under the assurance of R&D resources and formulate a business strategy.

			<div class="session">Background</div>
			<h2>The project started with a new AI algorithm developed by our R&D team.<br>
				We need to explore its market value and create new applications.</h2>
			<p>
				This project begins with an innovative clone voice AI algorithm that the RD team developed, which has
				the features of fast speed and a small corpus (a small amount of data). Still, we don't know whether
				these differences can add value for the users or whether it has commercial value. This project aims to
				explore this AI's market value and develop corresponding applications.
			</p>
			<img style="max-width: 800px;margin-bottom: 16px;">
			<p class="center">We can see AI reproduce someone's voice in some videos or movies, just like the Netflix
				documentary
				series“Andy Warhol Diaries” recreated the artist's voice with AI, making us think this technique seems
				familiar.
				But creating an AI model is different, expensive, and time-consuming. In the past, it was almost a
				privilege for a celebrity.
			</p>
			<div class="session">Step.1 Create MVP to discover the Market</div>
			<h2>Build minimum viable products in Waterfall Model to find the market fit</h2>
			<p>
				The first problem with this project is that the development time is too slow to support this type of
				project, and at the end of the project must roll out a complete application. But we need a simple
				prototype to explore the market and verify whether our core functions are in need. To solve this
				problem, I through the following adjustment to accelerate the development.
			</p>
			<h3>1. Define the market which we want to explore, detailed specifications and priorities: </h3>
			<p>
				Define the market and function priorities clearly, making it more logical to choose or sort the function
				in the roadmap or PRD.
				In terms of market segmentation, through sales feedback, we define two target markets to test the
				prototype: a small business ( like YouTubers) and corporation staff ( like News reporters). And we use
				different sales strategies and create two applications that can meet different scenarios and are more
				accessible to make function trade-offs.
				Then Small business is through marketing promotion. Corporation through sales and BD promotion.
			</p>
			<img>
			<h3>2. Adjust the specifications flexibly with the developed restriction</h3>
			<p>
				Build a fast communication workflow, more closely cooperate with the RD team, and adjust the
				specifications, framework, interaction, and other details with the difficulty or the restriction
			</p>
			<h3>3. Reduce the QA cost and schedule</h3>
			<p>
				Re-define which function would be needed to verify, such as how many phone models or browsers could be
				supported.
			</p>
			<div class="mb-lg"></div>
			<p>Through the above adjustment, the project's NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) can be significantly reduced,
				and the scale of the project will be smaller. This can give PMs more space to open the next project for
				this solution, just like the agile model.</p>
			<img>
			<div class="session">Step2. Based on feedback, put forward a proposal</div>
			<h3>Based on the market and sales feedback, we found some potential market demands,
				and we put forward design proposals for this:</h3>
			<h3>Proposal 1, Translating with your voice:
				Use the speaker's voice to shorten the distance between the audience in a multilingual situation.</h3>
			<p>Many corporations will use interpreters to dub in international remote conferences/seminars, which are
				becoming more and more during the lockdown.
				But this often leads to feeling apart from the audience. In some situations, they need to use their
				voice to shorten the distance from the audience.</p>
			<img>
			<h3>Proposal 2, Fast voice generation service with a large number of voice actors:
				Provide a secure and dedicated rental, private cloud server with multiple voice actors</h3>
			<p>With the vigorous development of podcasts, the sound economy is on the rise. Many news, magazines, story
				books, and other manuscripts in the market need to be converted into speech by a different voice.</p>
			<img>
			<div class="session">Step.3 Definition</div>
			<h3>Based on the technical feasibility and channel strategy,
				PM selects Proposal 2 as the development direction.</h3>
			<h3>We definite the function by user journey map and start design.</h3>
			<img style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
			<p class="center">This journey map shows how journalists complete their goals in this service.</p>
			<div class="session">Step.4 Design</div>
			<h3>GUI & User Flow</h3>

			<h3>UI for Progressive Web App</h3>
			<p>The design considers the development difficulty and strengthens the interaction of RWD.
				When users want to create a voice with a mobile device, this website-based service has a usage behavior
				similar to that of an APP</p>
